I enjoy the visualisation of information, hence, computer vision, data transformation, geo-data, and still exploring.
Have a look at the [projects](/projects/) section! 

#### Currently:

#### Was
- Solving [Advent of Code - 2024](https://github.com/bhupenderbindal/aoc_2024)


<!-- <a href="/projects/">projects</a> -->

#### Some helpful questions:
- "Does your model have data bias and leakage, and causing amazingly inflated metrics ?" 
- "Do I really need more computation or it's bad memory management ?"
- "Are you solving the right problem or lost in the middle of the project ?"


#### Quote from others:

“Models are almost always imperfect. This is fine as long as you are aware of this” - Michael Elad, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Computer Science
