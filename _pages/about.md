I am a master’s student in Computational Sciences in Engineering course at TU Braunschweig with a keen interest in machine learning and programming. Have a look at the [projects](/projects/) section! 
<!-- <a href="/projects/">projects</a> -->

Some helpful questions:
- "Does your model have data bias and leakage, and causing amazingly inflated metrics ?" 
- "Do I really need more computation or it's bad memory management ?"
- "Are you solving the right problem or lost in the middle of the project ?"


Quote from others:

“Models are almost always imperfect. This is fine as long as you are aware of this” - Michael Elad, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Computer Science
