# blog - memory leak
- if you use python and do a data-processing-transformation-save task. eveything goes good unless one day you run out of memory and process gets killed. obviosuly youll say "I need a bigger cpu". if following that conclusion you ask "do i really need a bigger cpu?", then you are opened to the beautiful quest of knowledge that will lead you to things like profiling, scope and garbage collection and how easy is to make mistakes if you do not pay attention to the python's abstraction and utility to write pseudo code gives you power that one shall use with a bit care.

The computer only does what we ask to do it, atleast in most of the cases, if we keep variables alive in the memory even if we dont need them, python compiler, oops interpreter, will keep them allocated in our cheap 64GB RAM.
